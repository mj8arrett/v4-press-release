# v4-press-release
Quite a few people are using v4 now in their projects, both new and upgraded.

We have a project that will go live by the end of the year so this is a good time to think about how we will launch v4 as a public release.

This document is based on the approach that Amazon takes when launching a new product, see here:

They write a document that contains two sections:

## Press release

This section imagines the product is ready to launch and describes:

- What the new product is
- Outlines the key features
- Who should use it

## FAQs

This section attempts to imagine the key questions that people would ask about the new product:

- How can I try it out?
- What are the technical requirements
- etc.
