# v4-press-release
Quite a few people are using v4 now in both new projects and upgraded sites.  Some of these are even in production.

We have a project that will go live by the end of the year, so this is a good time to think about how we will officially launch v4.

## Working backward

This document is based on the approach that Amazon takes when launching a new product; see here:

- https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management-Please-Derect-Call-now-%F0%9D%9F%AD-%F0%9D%9F%B4%F0%9D%97%A2-%F0%9D%9F%B4-%F0%9D%9F%B0-%F0%9D%9F%B0-%F0%9D%9F%B0-%F0%9D%9F%B0-%F0%9D%9F%B3

They write a document that contains two sections:

## Press release
This section imagines the product is ready to launch and describes:

- The productâ€™s name
- The intended customer
- The problem the product solves
- The benefits to the customer
- A call to action

See - https://github.com/mj8arrett/v4-press-release/blob/main/Press%20release%20section.md

## FAQ
This section answers the business or tactical questions about building and using the product and imagines the key questions that people would ask:

- What are the technical requirements?
- How do I upgrade?
- Who is using it?
- etc.

See - https://github.com/mj8arrett/v4-press-release/blob/main/Q%2BA%20Section.md

## How you can help
The dCA team will write the press release section.

Where we would like help is with the FAQ section.  What are the questions you would like to see answered?

This will help us ensure two things:

- Identify any issues that we need to resolve before launch.
- Ensure we provide the best documentation for existing and new users.

If you would like to contribute to the project, please drop me a note, and I will add you as a contributor.

Please note, as part of this process, I am learning to use git, so please bear with me!
